      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_2223.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Dan Gomez">
      
      <p>Currently pursuing a career in web development, to achieve my goal I have taken an extensive course where I have learned to operate with the latest technologies to
        create, manage, and deploy modern websites and web applications. I have gained enough knowledge to operate with HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, node.js, MySQL, MongoDB,
        and I have developed a deep understanding of back-end programming, during my studies I improved my abilities to think logically in a form that allows me to create 
         a program that can display back an interface, fully dynamic with complete back-end properties.</p>

      <p> During my studies I developed several web applications, and games as a practice way to implement the new knowledge obtained, I also participated in group projects
        where we build different applications such as a financial application, an educational game for children, and a platform to obtain bank loans to buy houses, these 
        projects are in my portfolio.      
      </p>
    
    <p>Houston, TX is where I attended Middle School and High School. in Middle School I took a "web mastering" class, and from that moment I became fascinated with the 
      things I could do on a computer and be able to display it on the world-wide-web.I participated in the making of the school website which helped to realize this was 
      something I truly enjoy.</p>
    
    <p>I am a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other cultures is something I enjoy a lot, 
      besides the U.S. and Venezuela, I also lived in England and Australia. I started my professional career by studying sound engineering, continued with business
      administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a company in Panama with my sister, we build and lease retail commercial 
      shops, we build them out of shipping containers. Recently I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a professional 
      full-stack web developer, a career that caught my attention from a young age.</p>
