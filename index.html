      <p>Currently pursuing a career in web development, to achieve my goal I have taken an extensive course where I have learned to operate with the latest technologies to
        create, manage, and deploy modern websites and web applications. I have gained enough knowledge to operate with HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, node.js, MySQL, MongoDB,
        and I have developed a deep understanding of back-end programming, during my studies I improved the ability to think logically in a form that allows me to create 
        and turn that creativity into a program that the computer can process and display back an interface, fully dynamic and with complete back-end properties.</p>

      <p>From the Caribbean, lover of Afro-descendant rhythms, music is truly a passion for me and a way to find peace and joy, creating and innovating has always been my
        interest, I believe that came from my father since he was very interested in all kind of new computerized technologies, and worked for the I. T department of a 
        very important oil company "P.D.V.S. A" he was also a musician and a singer, so I truly appreciate inheriting that from him </p>
    
    <p>The state of Texas, more specifically in the city of Houston is where I attended Middle School and High School and it was there where I learned English, in Middle School 
      I took a " web mastering" class, and from that moment I became fascinated with the things I could do on a computer and then be able to display it on the world-wide-web.
      I participated in the making of the school website and I felt really proud of being able to be part of that.</p>
    
    <p>I am a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other cultures is also my interest, 
      besides the U.S. and Venezuela, I also lived in England, Australia, and France. I started my professional career by studying sound engineering, I didn't complete 
      it then I switched to business administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a company in Panama with my sister, we build and lease retail commercial 
      shops, we build them out of shipping containers. Now that I am a bit more financially stable I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a 
      full-stack web developer, something that caught my attention from a young age.</p>
