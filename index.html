      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_2223.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Born in Venezuela, a country with severe social/political issues and ever since I have use of my reasoning I noticed that the society 
        where I come from has faced many cultural crisis. Came to the U.S.A at the age of 12, my mother and I moved here in the search 
        of better opportunities for our future.</p>
    
    <p>The state of Texas, more specifically in the city of Houston is where I attended middleschool and highschool and it was there where
         I learned English, in middleschool I took a " web mastering" class and from that moment I became fascinated with the things I could
          do on the computer and then being able to display it on the world-wide web. I participated in the making of the school website and I 
          felt really proud of being able to be part of that.</p>
    
    <p>I am a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other 
        cultures are also my interest, I lived in England, Australia, and France. I started my professional career by studying sound engineering,
         I didn't complete it then I switched to business administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a company in Panama with my 
         sister, we build and lease retail commercial shops, we build them out of shipping containers. Now that I am a bit more financially stable
          I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a fullstack web developer, something that I became very entrained with 
          since a young age.</p>
