      <p>Currently pursuing a career in web development, to achieve my goal I have taken an extensive course where I have learned to operate with the latest technologies to
        create, manage, and deploy modern websites and web applications. I have gained enough knowledge to operate with HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, node.js, MySQL, MongoDB,
        and I have developed a deep understanding of back-end programming, during my studies I improved my abilities to think logically in a form that allows me to create 
         a program that can display back an interface, fully dynamic with complete back-end properties.</p>

      <p>Born in the Caribbean, lover of Afro-descendant rhythms, music is truly a passion and a way for me to find peace and joy, creating and innovating has always been in my
        interest, I believe that came from my father since he was very interested in informrtion technology, and worked for the I.T. department of an important 
        national oil company "P.D.V.S. A" he was also a musician and a singer, so I truly appreciate inheriting that from him  </p>
    
    <p>The state of Texas, more specifically in the city of Houston is where I attended Middle School and High School, in Middle School 
      I took a "web mastering" class, and from that moment I became fascinated with the things I could do on a computer and be able to display it on the world-wide-web.
      I participated in the making of the school website which helped to realize this was something I truly enjoy.</p>
    
    <p>I am a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other cultures is something I enjoy a lot, 
      besides the U.S. and Venezuela, I also lived in England and Australia. I started my professional career by studying sound engineering, continued with business
      administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a company in Panama with my sister, we build and lease retail commercial 
      shops, we build them out of shipping containers. Recently I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a professional 
      full-stack web developer, a career that caught my attention from a young age.</p>
