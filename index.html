      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_2223.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Dan Gomez">

      <p>From the Caribbean, lover of Afro descendant rhythms, music is truly a passion for me and a way to find peace and joy, creating and 
        innovating has always been my interest, I believe that came from my father since he was very interested in all kind of new computerized  
        technologies, and worked for the I. T department of a very important oil company "P.D.V.S. A" he was also a musician and a singer, so I truly 
        appreciate inheriting that from him </p>
    
    <p>The state of Texas, more specifically in the city of Houston is where I attended middleschool and highschool and it was there where
         I learned English, in middleschool I took a " web mastering" class and from that moment I became fascinated with the things I could
          do on a computer and then to be able to display it on the world-wide web. I participated in the making of the school website and I 
          felt really proud of being able to be part of that.</p>
    
    <p>I am a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other 
        cultures are also my interest, beside the U.S. and Venezuela I also lived in England, Australia, and France. I started my professional career by studying 
      sound engineering, I didn't complete it then I switched to business administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a company in Panama with my 
         sister, we build and lease retail commercial shops, we build them out of shipping containers. Now that I am a bit more financially stable
          I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a fullstack web developer, something that that cought my attention from a young age.</p>
